tunnel provider.

Available on the App Store:
<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meow-smart-vpn/id6778303404>. Want the latest
builds early? The public beta is open on TestFlight:
<https://testflight.apple.com/join/HSptQN3h>.
Requires iOS 18 or later (iPhone, iPad, and iPhone Duo). Bring your own Mihomo / Clash
subscription — meow does not provide proxy servers.

Latest version: **v1.4.0** (July 2026) — dark mode across the app, QR-code
export for `ss://` profiles and subscription URLs, and a refreshed cat
branding. Since then, `main` also picked up a wake-from-idle reliability
fix — after sleep/wake the tunnel probes its data path and only restarts
when the probe fails — plus a meow-rs engine bump to 0.18.0 and a leading
swipe menu for refreshing individual subscriptions. See the
[release notes](https://github.com/meow-rs/meow-ios/releases) for earlier
per-version changelogs.

## Building

The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` via
[`xcodegen`](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen):

```sh
brew install xcodegen
./scripts/generate-xcodeproj.sh
```

The native library is built separately and wrapped as a single XCFramework
that both the app and extension link against:

```sh
./scripts/build-rust.sh   # → MeowCore/Frameworks/MeowCore.xcframework
```

See [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md) for toolchain requirements.
